## chargecontrol adapter for ioBroker

This adapter allows you in a simple way, to use the PV surplus energy to charge your vehicle!

### DISCLAIMER

This adapter **is not** published into ioBroker as it runs on my private installation!
If you want to use this adapter in your own installation, you need to change and/or update things *before* you can use it.

Why is it on Github anyways?  
I am using the automated checking of repositories, to maintain my personal installation :-)
